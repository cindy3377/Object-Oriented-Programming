Usage of GitHub Copilot:
* I used Copilot to generate the initial structure of each method.
* Experimented with writing comments and letting Copilot generate the method body.
* Modified the generated code to incorporate a different loop structure.
  

Evaluation:
* GitHub Copilot is beneficial for quickly generating code structures.
* It adapts to coding styles but may require careful review for complex logic.
* It helps streamline routine coding tasks.
