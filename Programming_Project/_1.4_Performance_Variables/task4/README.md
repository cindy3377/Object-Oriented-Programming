Task 4: // Pseudocode for the main loop of the simulator using the three-phase simulation approach

Initialize Simulation

    while (SimulationNotComplete) {
    
        // A-phase: Determine the time of the next event
        nextEvent = eventList.getNextEvent();
        simulationClock = nextEvent.getTime();
        
        // B-phase: Execute all B-events due at the current time
        while (nextEvent.getTime() == simulationClock) {
            if (nextEvent.getType() == EventType.ARRIVAL) {
                // Process arrival event
                generateServiceStartEvent(); // Generate the corresponding start service event
            } else if (nextEvent.getType() == EventType.FINISH_SERVICE) {
                // Process finish service event
                processServiceCompletion();
            }
    
        // Remove the processed event from the event list
            nextEvent = eventList.getNextEvent();
        }
    
        // C-phase: Execute all C-events
        executeConditionalEvents();
    
        // Continue the loop until a predetermined run-length or set number of arrivals is reached
    }

    // End of Simulation

This pseudocode outlines the main loop of a simulator using the three-phase simulation approach. It involves continuously iterating through the A-phase, B-phase, and C-phase until a predefined condition (e.g., run-length or number of arrivals) is met. The A-phase determines the time of the next event, the B-phase executes all B-events due at the current time, and the C-phase executes all C-events. The simulation continues to loop through these phases until the specified condition is satisfied.
