Task 5: Explanation of Simulator Coding:

a) A-phase Coding:

In the A-phase, you generate arrivals and process arrival events.
Classes involved: ArrivalGenerator, ArrivalEventProcessor.

Example code: generateArrivals();
handleArrivals();

b) B-event Coding:

In the B-phase, you perform services for active service points.
Classes involved: ServiceProcessor.

Example code: processService();

c) C-event Coding:

In the C-phase, you calculate performance measures.
Classes involved: PerformanceCalculator.

Example code: calculatePerformanceMeasures();
This separation of phases and coding tasks helps maintain a modular and organized structure for the simulator. The A, B, and C events represent different stages of the simulation, allowing for clear and systematic development.
