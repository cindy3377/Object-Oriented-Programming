Task 2: Categories of Performance Measures Maintenance/Update/Computation:

Performance measures can be categorized based on what they represent in the system. In general terms, these categories include:

Arrival and Service Counts (A, C): These are directly observable and are updated as clients arrive and are serviced.

Time-related Measures (B, T): These involve the tracking of time spent in service (B) and the overall simulation time (T).

Utilization and Throughput (U, X): These are derived from arrival, service, and time-related measures, providing insights into the efficiency of the system.

Service and Waiting Times (S, Rùëñ, W): These measures involve the calculation of time durations related to service, waiting, and response times.

Averages and Queue Length (R, N): These measures provide insights into the average times and queue lengths in the system.
