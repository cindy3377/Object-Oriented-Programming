Task 3: (W) Designing Systems with Service Points:

Consider two different systems with three or four service points, such as a hospital or a bank. In a hospital, the service points could represent different departments like emergency, consultation, and diagnostics. In a bank, they could represent tellers, customer service desks, loan departments, and ATMs. The graphical representation would involve circles for service points, arrows for customer flow, and database symbols for queues. The connections between these symbols would illustrate the flow of clients through the system.
