Suppose you are compiling statistics on the age structure of students in our group. You should then draw 1000 age values, and these should be distributed in the same way as the age distribution of the students in the group. How do you do it? Explain the algorithm in enough details to be able to program it directly. Take an idea/model from the example in section Your own distribution.



To simulate the age distribution of students in the group, we can use a probability-based approach. Define age ranges and their corresponding probabilities, then generate random numbers to assign ages based on these ranges and probabilities. For each simulation:

Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
Determine the age range by comparing the random number to cumulative probabilities.
Increment the count for the corresponding age range.
Repeat until 1000 simulations are done.
Output the result, showing the age, count, and percentage share.
