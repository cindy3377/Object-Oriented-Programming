Question:

Familiarize yourself with a few distributions that could be used in the simulator for experimentation. These distributions could be used in the following situations. Find answers online. You can also study other distributions. For example, Google "real-life example of normal distribution".

Answer:

Normal Distribution: Used to model many natural phenomena, such as height or test scores. For example, human height tends to follow a normal distribution, with most people clustering around the average height.



Binomial Distribution: Applied to experiments with a fixed number of trials, each having two possible outcomes. For instance, the number of successes (e.g., heads in coin tosses) in a series of coin flips.

Exponential Distribution: Models the time between events in a Poisson process. It's suitable for scenarios like the time between customer arrivals at a service center.

Poisson Distribution: Describes the number of events occurring in fixed intervals when events are rare and random. An example is the number of phone calls received at a call center during a fixed time period.
