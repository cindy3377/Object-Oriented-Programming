(W) Continue with the three-phase simulation example (section Telephone call centre example:
hand simulation) until one client of client type Y exits the system. Return your solution 
as an attachment to the solution of this exercise.

Answer:
An example and explanation for three-phase simulation:
* 	Phase 1 - Arrivals: Customers of different types (let's say X and Y) start calling 
the center. Just like in real life, calls aren't evenly spaced out; they come in randomly. 
We need to track when each customer arrives.
* 	Phase 2 - Service: When a customer reaches the front of the line, they start talking 
to an agent. It's like when you're finally talking to a customer service representative. 
The agent assists the customer, and this takes some time.
* 	Phase 3 - Departures: After the conversation is over, the customer leaves the call center. 
We record when each customer exits, and we're particularly interested in the moment when 
a customer of type Y exits the system.

This is similar to monitoring when a specific type of customer ends their call and leaves the center. 
The goal is to track the progress of each customer and know exactly when one of those type Y 
customers finally leaves the system.
