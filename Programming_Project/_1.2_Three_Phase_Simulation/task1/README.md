(W) a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event? b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?

Answers:

(a) Imagine you're simulating a busy coffee shop. When a customer walks in, it doesn't mean that's the only customer for the day, right? 
Customers keep arriving randomly. So, an arrival event generates another arrival event to mimic this continuous stream of customers. 
It's like when one customer finishes ordering their coffee, another customer can step in.

(b) Think of it this way: When a customer finally gets their turn at the counter to place their order, what's the next logical step? 
It's when they've placed their order and are ready to leave, having been served. That's why, at the start of the service, 
we often generate a departure event. This departure event represents the customer completing their interaction and leaving 
the coffee shop. It's essential for tracking things like how long customers wait and how busy the shop is at different times.
